  ### Contributions
  I had a lot of help on this assignment.  Special thanks to Pete Kriengsiri for help with the static files and making sure the get * path goes last.  My tutor was a big help working through the different folders and separating the routes into their own files.  Also, I found a great tutorial on the .filter technique to use for my delete route at [javascript tutorial](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-array-filter/).
